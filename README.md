# liblettercase

This library was created as a playground for some C++ features.
The idea was to play around with as many modern software development concepts as possible and string them together in the context of C++ development.

I felt like I could use an upgrade to my existing knowledge - and now we are here.
These concepts include:

* testing and benchmarking forced through git hooks
* forcing a specific project layout convention which would be an improvement compared to my previous experiences
* using CMake as a buildtool
